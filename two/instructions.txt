Background

Create a web service that consumes two separate streams of increasing integers and can be 
queried to return the next element of the “merged” list, maintaining increasing order. 

Example

If the two data streams return the following,

Stream 1 => 2,6,11,14,15,21...

Stream 2 => 10,11,22,50,88,...

then calls to your service should yield:

2, 6, 10, 11, 11, 14, 15, 21, 22, 50, 88, ...

Server Endpoint

HTTP URL: https://api.xxxxxxxxxxxx.com/quiz/next/<stream_name>

Note:

 Stream_name: any string value without spaces or special characters 

HTTP Method: GET 

HTTP Response (JSON):

{

"last": <the last stream value>

"current": <the current stream value>

"stream": <stream_name>

}

App Requirements

The local web server should have the following functionalities:

1. We should be able to query your server with

HTTP URL:

http://localhost:<port>/quiz/merge?stream1=<stream_name_1>&stream2=<stream_name_2>

Note: 

 stream_name_1: any string value without spaces or special characters, e.g. A, foo, etc 

 stream_name_2: any string value without spaces or special characters, e.g. B, bar, etc

HTTP Method: GET

HTTP response body:

{

"last": 2,

"current": 3

}

2. Must communicate with server endpoint to consume streams of data

3. You may use a web framework of your choice

4. Do not need to actually deploy the server

5. Just send over your code and some brief instructions so we can get it up and running locally
